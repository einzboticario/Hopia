# Hopia
Hopia is an exercise C# application that runs with face recognition and several pre-made voice commands â€” made with Emgu.CV, AForge and some built-in speech synthesizer.

This is an old project of mine way back 2018 from watching different kinds of YouTube tutorials. lol
If you want to use the code, feel free to do so.

Thanks!
