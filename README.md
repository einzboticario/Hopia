# Hopia
Hi! Hopia is a C# application that has face recognition and some pre-made voice commands â€” made with Emgu.CV, AForge and some built-in speech synthesizer.

This is an old project of mine (late 2018) from watching different kinds of YouTube tutorials lol.
If you want to use the code, feel free to do so.
I know the upload is kinda messy, please bear with it.

Thanks!
